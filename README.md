2. ## Gerry's Grill
     <p>Originally opening in 1997 in Quezon City, Phillipines, Gerry's Grill has rapidly expanded outside of the Phillipines and into your local area! Gerry's Grill is a popular restaurant for all your filipino favorites. If you want to have a formal sit-down dinner, Gerry's Grill is a popular local spot where many filipinos enjoy eating at. Some popular dishes include crispy pata (my all-time favorite filipino dish), lechon kawali, chicken pork adobo, beef kaldareta, sizzling sisig, and many more cultural cravings. Need something to wrap up your meal? You NEED to try their halo-halo! Buko pandan and leche flan are also some other fan favorites.</p>

3. ## Salo Salo Grill
    <p>Located in Cerritos, this hot spot has delicious filipino platters. Looking for a snack? They have those too. If you're a rice lover, you HAVE to try their adobo fried rice or bagoong fried rice. Maybe something crispy? Try some of their Crispy Favorites such as their crispy pata, lechon ribs, or lechon kawalli. If these don't appease you, definitely look into their Sizzling Plates! Their sisig is a must-try. Adobo fan? They have chicken AND pork adobo. Thirsty? Calalmansi juice or sago-gulaman are some top choices on any hot day. If drinks won't suffice, they also have ice cream with a wide range of filipino flavors and other filipino desserts that will make your mouth water! </p>

4. ## Bakers and Baristas
    <p>Bakers and Baristas is not your traditional filipino brunch spot, fusing filipino cuisine with their many dishes. Nonetheless, Bakers and Baristas is the perfect hang-out spot for any meal. Opened by two brothers in 2015, this restaurant specializes in breakfast, lunch, or brunch! My personal favorite dish is their Roasted Pork Belly Bowl, which includes garlic rice, fried egg, cabbage slaw, and pork belly! If you're looking into a more traditional filipino breakfast, their Tapsilog is to die for. Marinated sirloin (tapa), white garlic rice, fried egg, with a side of banana ketchup. Bakers and Baristas also have a selection of burritos, pancakes, and toast! Be sure to try their unique collection of coffees and teas. They have different flavors such as Sparkling Matcha Yuzu, Chrysanthemum, Matcha, Vanilla Bean, Honey Lavender, Honey Oat, Salted Caramel, and multiple other options. Bakers and Baristas should be on your list for your next brunch spot! </p>
